Manufacturers take too long to become climate neutral. CO₂ok fills this gap and allows your customers to buy everything they want, without contributing to climate change! This is also called ‘Cause Marketing’.",
  s3_p3: "The plugin is entirely free for webshop owners. It only takes 1 minute to install the CO₂ok-plugin. When you integrated the plugin in your webshop, your customers can make their own choice to contribute. That way they make their purchase climate neutral. The minor extra free is on average 1%.",
  s3_p4: "Both installing our plugin and using it can be done with just one click. Nothing about the ordering-process changes. You won’t lose customers by any tedious procedures. If you bump into a problem with the plugin, we’re always available through mail or by phone.",
