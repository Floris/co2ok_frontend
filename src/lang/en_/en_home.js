            How do we know how much CO₂ is emitted during the production of goods ? And how much do we want to ask you to contribute to offset those emissions ? Although it is difficult, we have a good solution. The answer to the first question may not sound satisfactory.After all, it is very difficult to calculate how much CO₂ should be compensated for each product in order to shop climate - neutral.There is no way to do this quickly and well - founded for an organization like ours.There are too many variables that we should take into account.It would take us two months per product.In that time we can do much more useful things for nature together, right ?
            </p>

            A solution would be
            if manufacturers take care of this.
            "To produce this shoe, 30 kilos of CO₂ were emitted."
            Not only would it make us all a lot more aware of how we deal with our world, it would also adorn the producers.We would know exactly how much we have to compensate to be able to shop climate neutral.

  s6_p: `No. Although trees in themselves do take up CO zich, there are several reasons to doubt the effect of such projects: Only after 50 years does a forest begin to have a real effect on climate protection. If the forest is cut down before that time or disappears in another way (for example as a result of a pest infection), the profit is canceled. The protection of one forest cannot prevent the forest from being felled next to it - so on balance no profit. Atmosfair gives here
